# COVID19 Data Analysis

## Welcome!
Welcome to **COVID19 Data Analysis using Python**. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the project objectives and structure:

## Project Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on **three** learning objectives:

1. Learn the steps, needed to be taken to prepare your data sources for an analysis
2. Learn how to look at your data to find a good measure to establish your analysis based upon
3. Learn to visualize the result of your analysis

By the end of this project, we will learn how to preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for an Analysis. in this Course we are going to work with **COVID19** dataset, published by **John Hopkins University**, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also we have another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. **We are going to merge these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country.**

## Project Structure
The hands on project on **COVID19** Data Analysis using Python is divided into following tasks:

### Task 1: Introduction
Understand the purpose of the project, the datasets that will be used, and the question we will answer with our analysis.

### Task 2: Importing COVID19 dataset
Import COVID19 dataset and prepare it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.

### Task 3: Finding a good Measure
Decide on and calculate a good measure for our analysis.

### Task 4: Importing World happiness report dataset
Import World happiness report dataset, dropping useless columns and Merge it with COVID19 dataset to find correlations among our data.

### Task 5: Visualizing the results
Visualize our results using Seaborn.
